# Stack-Implementation
## Aim - To study about the implementation of Stack.
### Description - A stack is a linear list where all insertions and deletions are permitted only at one end of the list. When elements are added to stack it grow at one end. Similarly, when elements are deleted from a stack, it shrinks at the same end. I have written a C program that performs push, pop and display operations on a stack.
